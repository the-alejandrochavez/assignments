            <p>With a solid foundation in computer science acquired during my high school years, I immersed myself in
                languages like
                Python, Java, and JavaScript, igniting a passion for programming that would shape my academic and
                professional pursuits.
                This knowledge paved the way for my university studies, earning a bachelor's degree in computer
                engineering. I seized
                every opportunity I was able to get, embarking on projects that ranged from crafting a Bluetooth speaker
                during an
                internship to contributing to the development of a groundbreaking smart shower using a touch screen to
                set the
                temperature of the shower in my final year. During the summer, I was able to go back into frontend
                development, using
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating a few games and projects. These experiences not only solidified my
                technical skills
                but also instilled in me an appreciation for innovation and collaborative problem-solving.</p>
